9. Expiry: The AT HOP card (including any HOP money or Products loaded on the AT HOP card) will expire if the AT HOP card is not used, no refund is requested, the AT HOP card is cancelled, or no Products are loaded onto the AT HOP card for a continuous period of six years. When an AT HOP card expires, any HOP money or Products remaining on the AT HOP card will be forfeited and become our property on and from the date the AT HOP card is cancelled.

That was on the expired card immediately before it expired.
Please note that for an unregistered AT HOP card that has expired, we will need you to present the expired card at an AT Customer Service Centre.

10. Suspension: We may suspend any AT HOP card or AT HOP online account (Online Account) if you breach any of these Terms and such breach amounts to what AT determines to be fraud or fare evasion. In the event that we suspend any AT HOP card or Online Account:

10.1. The suspension will remain in force for such period as we may direct; and
10.2. We may require the payment of a reasonable administration fee (and impose such other terms as we deem necessary or desirable as a condition of reactivation of a suspended AT HOP card or Online Account.

11.1. If your AT HOP card is registered on our Website (Registered AT HOP card), you may apply to cancel your AT HOP card and receive a refund of the remaining HOP Money on your AT HOP card within 14 days of your completed application being received. Only unused HOP Money can be refunded. No refunds are available for paper tickets purchased. No refunds are available for Period Passes. Any refund given by us is inclusive of any goods and services tax (GST).
11.2. You acknowledge and agree that the cancellation and refund option set out in section 11.1 is available only for Registered AT HOP cards. If your AT HOP card is not registered, then no HOP Money can be refunded to you.

If the remaining balance is negative we retain the right to recover the negative balance and may engage a collection agency the cost of which the card holder shall be liable.
11.4. For AT HOP cards loaded with SuperGold travel concession: Tagging on and off when you travel is essential because the tag on and off locations allow AT to accurately identify the subsidy that should be applied to the fare and claim that subsidy from the NZ government. For this reason, we may cancel the card (except where it has a monthly Period Pass loaded on it) for repeated failure to tag on and off. We will attempt to contact you before such cancellation. In this instance you may contact us and we will transfer any HOP money or the HOP money equivalent of any inactivated Products to another AT HOP card purchased by you.

13. AT HOP card Transfer: Where you lawfully hold an AT HOP card, you may (unless the AT HOP card is a Registered AT HOP card) permanently give that AT HOP card to another person and we will treat the new holder of the AT HOP card as the lawful holder, and he or she will be bound by these Terms.

14. AT HOP card Return: We may at any time require you to return your AT HOP card in a manner notified by us. If this happens, we will replace your AT HOP card with a new AT HOP card having equivalent Products loaded on it.

22.1. You can add HOP Money and/or Products to your AT HOP card at our offices, via Retail Agents, top up machines, by Auto top up in accordance with section 22.2 (for Registered AT HOP cards), at AT Customer Service Centres or a one off top up via our Website (for Registered AT HOP cards).

26.5. You do not comply with these Terms.

27. Determination of HOP Money and Other Products:

27.1. The determination by us, a Retail Agent or a Public Transport Operator (as the case may be) as to the amount of HOP Money and other Products on an AT HOP card will be final and conclusive. We reserve the right to correct the Products loaded on your AT HOP card if we believe that a technical or accounting error has occurred. For the purposes of such determination, the value of Products as determined by us, a Retail Agent or a Public Transport Operator from any of the following sources will be deemed to be conclusive and binding:
27.1.1. The Products encoded in the AT HOP card; or
27.1.2. Our records, including records that we generate from the System.
27.2. If we determine that, as a result of error by us, the wrong Product or wrong amount of HOP Money is deducted from your AT HOP card for a public transport journey, we will refund to you as HOP Money (unless we in our sole discretion determine to give such refund) the difference between the amount deducted from your AT HOP card and the correct fare or Product value for the relevant public transport journey.

28. Obligation to Examine: You must check the AT HOP card on purchase or issue and on each addition or subtraction of Products to the AT HOP card.

29. Debits for Products and Fees: The AT HOP card will be debited at tag on in the circumstances set out below:

29.1. When you use an AT HOP card to pay for a public transport journey, the System will check for a valid fare as follows:
29.1.1. Is there a Period Pass to match the journey undertaken? If yes – the fare detail is recorded, if not:

29.1.3. The System deducts the fare from HOP Money.

30. Transaction Details:

30.1. All transaction details, trip details, and other details recorded as a result of you using your AT HOP card will be recorded and retained by us. After you deposit HOP Money or Products on your AT HOP card, we will update the AT HOP card balance to reflect that deposit:
30.1.1. Immediately, if you add Products to your AT HOP card at our offices, via a Retail Agent, at an AT Customer Service Centre, or using a top up machine; or
30.1.2. Immediately, if you have established an Auto top-up facility in accordance with section 22.2. In this case the direct debit payment instruction will be triggered, once the specified minimum balance has been reached and your AT HOP card has been automatically reloaded; or
30.1.3. At the next tag on event once we receive payment for the Products into our bank account (usually the next business day after your online transaction is processed) if you add HOP Money and/or Products to your AT HOP card using our Website.

30.5. We may add or update any Online Transaction History at any time.

31. Refund of Fares:

31.1. In the event of any refund claim being received we will investigate the circumstances of the claim. If we determine that the claim was the result of faulty equipment, a Faulty card or a fault in the AT HOP system, we will refund the appropriate fare overcharge.
31.2. If we do decide to provide a fare refund per section 31.1:
31.2.1. For Registered AT HOP cards: the refund will be paid as HOP money that can only be collected when your Registered AT HOP card is next tagged on to the System;
31.2.2. For unregistered AT HOP cards: We will work with you to determine the easiest way to apply the top up, as this must be completed in person.

Trust Arrangements, Interest and GST

32. Trust Arrangements: We maintain in a separate bank account an amount in excess of the face value of all Products that we are liable to repay to holders of AT HOP cards in accordance with section 11 less any amounts cancelled, redeemed or otherwise forfeited in accordance with these Terms from time to time, which is held on trust for all holders of AT HOP cards. You have a right to a proportion of the account equal to the value of the Products loaded on your AT HOP card that we are liable to repay to holders of AT HOP cards in accordance with section 11 less any amounts cancelled, redeemed or otherwise forfeited in accordance with these Terms from time to time. The bank where the account is maintained has been given written notice of the status of the account as a trust account for all holders of AT HOP cards.

Public Transport Operators and Public Transport Journeys

35. Public Transport Operators: Certain authorised Public Transport Operators have entered into agreements with us to accept HOP Money and/or Products on an AT HOP card as a means of payment for public transport journeys on services run by those Public Transport Operators. If a Public Transport Operator notifies us that it no longer accepts the AT HOP card as a means of payment, we will communicate this to customers as soon as reasonably practical via the notice methods set out in section 39.

36. Product Types: Public Transport Operators may accept any Product as available from time to time for public transport journeys using the AT HOP card. We may at any time add, remove or amend the Products available using the AT HOP card. AT reserves the right to limit the usage of these Products whether by operator, mode, date or time. Where possible, we will give you at least two weeks’ notice via the notice methods set out in section 39.

37. HOP Money: The following provisions apply if the HOP Money Product is available:

37.1. Each time you add HOP Money to your AT HOP card, you must add a minimum of $5 (incl. GST). You will only be able to add HOP Money equal to or above this minimum loadable value.
37.2. The maximum amount of HOP Money that may be held on any AT HOP card is $300 (incl. GST).
37.3. Notwithstanding section 26 (Right to Refuse), Public Transport Operators may permit you to commence a public transport journey, and to complete each trip of the journey, as long as there is a positive or $0.00 HOP Money balance on the AT HOP card for each leg of your journey. HOP Money contained on multiple AT HOP cards cannot be combined to pay a single fare.

38. Period Pass Products (Monthly and Day passes): The following provisions apply if the Period Pass Product is available:

38.1. A Period Pass is available for unlimited bus and train journeys within defined zones or for unlimited travel on specified ferry services. One type of bus/train Period Pass and one type of ferry Period Pass may be stored on an AT HOP card at any time. A new Period Pass may be loaded onto an AT HOP card when the previous Period Pass has been activated.
38.2. A monthly pass is activated by "tagging on" and expires when the specified number of days from the day of activation has elapsed.
38.3. A day pass is activated by “tagging on” and is valid until 11.59pm the same calendar day.

39. Fare Changes and Information:

39.1. You acknowledge that fares may change from time to time. HOP Money will be deducted at the fare, fee or rate in effect when the AT HOP card is used for a journey. AT will give you at least two weeks’ notice of a fare change, where that fare change is instigated by us. A Period Pass that you have already commenced using prior to a fare change will be honoured at that pre-change price. 
39.2. AT will also endeavour to give you at least two weeks’ notice of changes to timetables and routes.

39.4. Information about the fares, routes, concessions, and other information relating to public transport journeys is available from AT.govt.nz

40. Default Fares: When you do not correctly complete both a "tag on" and "tag off" transaction for your trip, a default fare may be charged. The default will be calculated and applied to your HOP Money balance at your next "tag on" event. If the application of a default fare puts your HOP Money balance below $0.00, you will be unable to "tag on" using HOP Money until such time as additional HOP Money has been loaded onto your AT HOP card. The exercise of remedies available under this section will not restrict the exercise of any additional or alternative remedies, including other remedies in these terms of use.

40.1. The default fare on rail and bus is currently the equivalent of the three zone fare based on the profile of the card (i.e. child, secondary, adult, accessible or SuperGold). Please note the tertiary default fare is equal to a three zone adult fare.
40.2. The default fare on ferry is equivalent to the AT HOP fare for the service. Where multiple services leave through one tag on point, the higher of the HOP fares charged is the applicable default fare.
40.3. Bus, rail and ferry fares can be viewed at https://at.govt.nz/bus-train-ferry/fares-discounts/

41. Public Transport Operator's Conditions of Carriage: When you travel using the Public Transport Operators, you do so in accordance with any applicable legislation, regulations, conditions of carriage, and conditions of use (including any signs and notices displayed by the relevant Public Transport Operator) relating to that travel (Public Transport Operator's Conditions of Carriage).

Where required by the Public Transport Operator's Conditions of Carriage applicable to your public transport journey, you must hold your AT HOP card against or near the Fare Payment Device (FPD) such that the FPD provides a visual or audible acknowledgement that it has successfully processed your AT HOP card (each a "tag").
